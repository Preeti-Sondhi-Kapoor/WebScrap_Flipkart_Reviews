This project uses Python, urllib and Beautiful Soup. The urllib.request module is used to open URLs. The Beautiful Soup is a Python library for extracting data out of HTML and XML files. We can use the Beautiful Soup library to parse document, and extract the text from tags.

CAUTION

As a word of CAUTION, web scraping sometimes breaks a company terms of use, and could get you in trouble with the law, thus you should be careful about which sites you scrape. This repo mainly serves as my personal portfolio and for educational purpose for others who are interested in web scraping.
